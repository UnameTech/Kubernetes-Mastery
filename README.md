# **Module: Kubernetes – From Monoliths to Microservices at Scale**

---

##  **Introduction**

As you’ve seen, Docker lets us package applications into containers that work anywhere. But in the real world, you rarely run one container. Modern applications are built with **microservices** — dozens or hundreds of containers working together.

Manually managing, scaling, updating, and networking these containers is impossible without automation.

That’s where **Kubernetes (K8s)** comes in.

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration tool that **automates** deployment, scaling, high availability, and management of your containerized apps.

This module covers **everything from beginner to expert**, including:
- CKA and CKAD certification topics  
- Real-world **EKS deployment with AWS integrations**  
- Advanced CI/CD and microservices orchestration  
- Jenkins-Kubernetes pipelines  
- Observability and scaling with autoscalers  
- Enterprise-grade ingress, security, and monitoring  

---

##  **Module Objective**

To make you production-ready in Kubernetes and AWS EKS, with solid foundational knowledge, practical labs, and the ability to deploy and manage scalable, secure, observable applications using microservices.
